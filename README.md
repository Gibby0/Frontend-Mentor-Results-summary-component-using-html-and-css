### What I learned
In this project, I learned how to structure HTML semantically for better accessibility and SEO. Additionally, I enhanced my understanding of CSS by using custom properties, Flexbox for layout, and integrating Google Fonts.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```
```css
body{
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: flex-start; 
    align-items: center;
    display: flex;
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to continue focusing on improving my CSS skills, particularly in areas like responsive design and CSS grid layouts.
I plan to continue learning more about Flexbox in order to fully utilize it within my projects. 

### Useful resources

 [Google Fonts - HankenGrotesk]('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Hanken+Grotesk:ital,wght@0,100..900;1,100..900&display=swap') - This helped me aquire the font needed for the project.
